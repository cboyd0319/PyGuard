**Result: ZERO critical security or correctness issues detected.**

This is exceptional. The codebase demonstrates:
- No hardcoded secrets or API keys
- No SQL injection vulnerabilities
- No unsafe deserialization
- No command injection risks
- No authentication bypasses
- No cryptographic weaknesses (in production code)

### 🟡 Major Issues (Quality Improvements)

#### 1. High Complexity Functions

**cli.py - main() function**
```
Current: 69 cyclomatic complexity, 478 lines
Recommended: <10 complexity, <50 lines per function
Impact: Difficult to test, maintain, understand
Priority: High
```

**Recommendation:** Refactor into smaller, focused functions:
```python
# BEFORE: God function doing everything
def main():
    # 478 lines of argument parsing, file processing, reporting...
    pass

# AFTER: Decomposed into logical units
def main():
    args = parse_arguments()
    cli = setup_cli(args)
    results = run_analysis(cli, args)
    generate_reports(results, args)

def parse_arguments(): ...
def setup_cli(args): ...
def run_analysis(cli, args): ...
def generate_reports(results, args): ...
```

**cli.py - run_full_analysis() function**
```
Current: 118 lines
Recommended: <50 lines
Impact: Testing, readability
Priority: Medium
```

**git_hooks_cli.py - main() function**
```
Current: 14 complexity, 160 lines
Recommended: <10 complexity, <50 lines
Priority: Medium
```

#### 2. Test Failures (13 tests)

**Category A: Feature Detection Gaps (6 tests)**
- CRYPTO006: Null IV detection (requires data flow analysis)
- QUART framework: Template rendering detection
- AI/ML security: Some rules need implementation updates

**Category B: Notebook Idempotency (2 tests)**
- PII warnings accumulate on repeated fixes
- Needs refactoring of warning injection logic

**Category C: CLI Output (2 tests)**
- Warning message format expectations
- Non-critical cosmetic issues

**Category D: Performance (1 test)**
- Flaky timing-dependent test
- Environment-specific

**Category E: Integration (2 tests)**
- External dependency expectations
- Test environment configuration

**Priority:** Medium - No critical functionality affected

#### 3. Test Coverage Gap

```
Current: 77.92%
Target: 87%
Gap: 9.08%
```

**Untested Areas:**
- Some error handling paths
- Edge cases in complex functions
- Some CLI option combinations

### 🟢 Minor Issues (Nice-to-Have Improvements)

#### 1. Magic Numbers (~1,500 instances)

**Example found:**
```python
# ❌ BEFORE
if len(items) > 10:
    print(f"... and {len(items) - 10} more")

# ✅ AFTER (FIXED in cli.py)
MAX_ITEMS_TO_DISPLAY = 10
if len(items) > MAX_ITEMS_TO_DISPLAY:
    print(f"... and {len(items) - MAX_ITEMS_TO_DISPLAY} more")
```

**Status:** Started fixing (cli.py complete), 1,496 remaining instances

#### 2. Line Length Issues (~1,000 instances)

Lines exceeding 100 characters. Most are:
- Long docstrings (acceptable)
- URL strings (acceptable)
- Complex conditions (should be refactored)

#### 3. Docstring Minor Issues

Some docstrings don't follow imperative mood:
```python
# ❌ "Convenience function..."
# ✅ "Provide convenient access to..."
```

**Status:** Most docstrings are comprehensive and well-written

## Detailed File-by-File Analysis (Sample)

### File: `pyguard/cli.py` (886 lines)

**Overall Quality: 7/10** - Good structure, needs refactoring

#### Strengths:
- ✅ Comprehensive argument parsing
- ✅ Rich UI integration
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns (mostly)
- ✅ Good error handling
- ✅ Type hints present

#### Issues Fixed:
- ✅ Magic numbers extracted to constants
- ✅ Code formatted consistently

#### Remaining Issues:
- ⚠️ main() function too complex (69 complexity, 478 lines)
- ⚠️ run_full_analysis() too long (118 lines)
- ⚠️ Some repeated code patterns

#### Recommended Refactoring:
```python
# Extract argument parsing
def create_argument_parser() -> argparse.ArgumentParser:
    """Create and configure argument parser."""
    # Move all parser.add_argument() calls here
    pass

# Extract special modes
def handle_secret_scanning(args, cli):
    """Handle --scan-secrets mode."""
    pass

def handle_import_analysis(args, cli):
    """Handle --analyze-imports mode."""
    pass

def handle_test_coverage(args, cli):
    """Handle --check-test-coverage mode."""
    pass

# Simplified main()
def main():
    args = create_argument_parser().parse_args()
    
    if args.scan_secrets:
        return handle_secret_scanning(args, PyGuardCLI())
    
    if args.analyze_imports:
        return handle_import_analysis(args, PyGuardCLI())
    
    # ... etc
    
    # Normal mode
    cli = PyGuardCLI(allow_unsafe_fixes=args.unsafe_fixes)
    results = run_analysis(cli, args)
    generate_reports(results, args)
```

### File: `pyguard/lib/crypto_security.py` (724 lines)

**Overall Quality: 9/10** - Excellent security module

#### Strengths:
- ✅ Comprehensive crypto checks (15 rules)
- ✅ Well-documented with CWE/NIST references
- ✅ Clear violation messages
- ✅ Type hints throughout
- ✅ Good AST analysis patterns

#### Minor Issues:
- ⚠️ CRYPTO006 doesn't detect null IVs in variables (data flow analysis needed)
- 🟢 Some complex conditions could be extracted to helper methods

#### Example of Excellence:
```python
def _check_hardcoded_keys(self, node: ast.Call, func_name: str):
    """CRYPTO002: Detect hardcoded cryptographic keys."""
    key_arg = self._get_keyword_arg(node, "key")
    
    if key_arg and isinstance(key_arg, ast.Constant):
        key_value = key_arg.value
        
        if isinstance(key_value, bytes) and len(key_value) >= 8:
            self._create_violation(
                node,
                "CRYPTO002",
                "Hardcoded Key",
                "Hardcoded cryptographic key detected. "
                "Keys must be stored securely and loaded at runtime.",
                "Load keys from secure storage: key = load_key_from_secure_storage()",
                RuleSeverity.CRITICAL,
                "CWE-321",
                "NIST SP 800-57",
            )
```
