# Reference Documentation

Deep dives, catalogs, and design documents live here. Use this folder when you need exact rule counts, architecture, or compliance evidence.

## Contents

Category | Files
--- | ---
Capabilities & rules | `capabilities-reference.md`, `security-rules.md`, `SUPPRESSIONS.md`, `CODE-SCANNING-ALERTS.md`
Architecture & implementation | `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `architecture/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`, `architecture/AUTOFIX_ANALYSIS.md`
Competitive & positioning | `COMPETING_PRODUCTS_COVERAGE.md`, `DISTRIBUTION_STRATEGY.md`
Operational references | `SUPPRESSIONS.md`, `CODE-SCANNING-ALERTS.md`

## How to Navigate

1. **Need a feature list or coverage numbers?** Start with `capabilities-reference.md` (security, framework, and auto-fix coverage tables).
2. **Explaining internals to auditors or contributors?** Use `ARCHITECTURE.md` for diagrams and `architecture/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` for module-level notes.
3. **Documenting fix safety?** Cite `architecture/AUTOFIX_ANALYSIS.md` which classifies safe vs. unsafe auto-fixes.
4. **Comparing tools?** Reference `COMPETING_PRODUCTS_COVERAGE.md` alongside the README to highlight advantages.

Every reference file follows the same tone guide in `../doc_templates/github-repo-docs-tone-guide.md`. When updating or adding docs, ensure tables, headings, and callouts remain concise and actionable.
