# Development Docs

This folder now focuses on **active** engineering references only. Historical and ad-hoc workflow checklists have been removed (see the repository history if needed).

## What lives here

Topic | File
--- | ---
Testing strategy | [TESTING_GUIDE.md](TESTING_GUIDE.md)
Workflow coverage checklist | [TESTING-WORKFLOWS.md](TESTING-WORKFLOWS.md)
Benchmarks & perf notes | [benchmarks.md](benchmarks.md)
Coverage dashboard snapshot | [COVERAGE_STATUS.md](COVERAGE_STATUS.md)
LTS / release policy | [LTS_POLICY.md](LTS_POLICY.md)
Notebook security engineering plan | [NOTEBOOK_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES.md](NOTEBOOK_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES.md)
API security completion summary | [API_SECURITY_COMPLETE.md](API_SECURITY_COMPLETE.md)

Architecture deep dives and auto-fix safety docs now live in [docs/reference/architecture/](../reference/architecture/). Examples remain in [docs/examples](../examples/).

If you need one-off workflow runbooks (e.g., “close code scanning alerts”), capture them in issues or the project tracker instead of committing new markdown files—this keeps the docs lean.
