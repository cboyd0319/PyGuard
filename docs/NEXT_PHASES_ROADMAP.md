## Implementation Strategy

### Prioritization Criteria

1. **Usage Frequency:** Rules used in 80%+ of projects (PEP 8, imports)
2. **Auto-Fix Capability:** Rules that can be safely auto-fixed
3. **Security Impact:** Security-related rules get higher priority
4. **Complexity:** Start with simpler rules, build to complex
5. **Dependencies:** Implement foundational rules before dependent ones

### Quality Gates

For each phase:
- ✅ 70%+ test coverage maintained
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ No performance regression (< 100ms per file)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Migration guide (where applicable)

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Phased Delivery:** Ship value incrementally, don't wait for 100%
2. **User Feedback:** Gather feedback after each phase
3. **Performance Monitoring:** Track analysis speed
4. **False Positive Tracking:** Monitor and minimize false positives
5. **Backward Compatibility:** Maintain compatibility or provide migration
