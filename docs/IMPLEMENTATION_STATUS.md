## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
1. **Scope Creep** - 800+ rules is ambitious
   - *Mitigation:* Prioritize by usage frequency, focus on auto-fixable rules
   
2. **Test Coverage Drop** - Adding many LOC could reduce coverage
   - *Mitigation:* Write tests first, maintain 70% threshold
   
3. **Performance** - More rules = slower analysis
   - *Mitigation:* Parallel processing, caching, incremental analysis

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Breaking Changes** - New modules might conflict
   - *Mitigation:* Maintain backward compatibility, versioning
   
2. **Maintenance Burden** - 800+ rules is lot to maintain
   - *Mitigation:* Good documentation, rule metadata, automated testing

### Low Priority Risks
1. **User Adoption** - Users might prefer specialized tools
   - *Mitigation:* Migration guides, compatibility modes
