## 🔬 Technical Deep Dive

### Architecture Patterns

```python
# Detector Pattern (all detectors follow this)
class SecurityDetector:
    """Base pattern for all detectors."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = PyGuardLogger()
    
    def scan_code(self, code: str) -> List[SecurityIssue]:
        """Scan code and return issues."""
        issues = []
        # Pattern matching
        # Context analysis
        # Issue generation
        return issues
```

### Standards Integration Pattern

```python
# Mapper Pattern (all mappers follow this)
class StandardsMapper:
    """Base pattern for standards mapping."""
    
    def map_to_standard(self, issue_type: str) -> List[Requirement]:
        """Map issue to standard requirements."""
        return self.mappings.get(issue_type, [])
    
    def generate_report(self, issues: List) -> Dict:
        """Generate compliance report."""
        # Aggregate by standard
        # Calculate compliance
        # Return structured report
        return report
```

### Testing Strategy

```python
# Test Pattern (all tests follow this)
class TestDetector:
    def setup_method(self):
        self.detector = Detector()
    
    def test_detects_vulnerability(self):
        """Test positive case."""
        code = "# vulnerable code"
        issues = self.detector.scan_code(code)
        assert len(issues) > 0
        assert issues[0].severity == "HIGH"
    
    def test_no_false_positives(self):
        """Test negative case."""
        code = "# safe code"
        issues = self.detector.scan_code(code)
        assert len(issues) == 0
```
