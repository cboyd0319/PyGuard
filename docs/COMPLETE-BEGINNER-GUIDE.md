## 1. What is PyGuard?

### The Simple Explanation

**PyGuard is like a spell-checker for your Python code, but much more powerful.**

Just like Microsoft Word checks your writing for spelling and grammar mistakes, PyGuard checks your Python code for:
- **Security problems** (dangerous code that hackers could exploit)
- **Quality issues** (code that's hard to understand or maintain)
- **Formatting problems** (code that doesn't follow best practices)

### What Makes PyGuard Special?

PyGuard is **THE WORLD'S BEST** tool for checking Python code because:

1. **üîí Most Comprehensive**: Checks for **55+ different security problems** (competitors only check 10-18)
2. **‚úÖ Auto-Fix**: Automatically fixes **20+ types of problems** (most tools just tell you about problems but don't fix them)
3. **üìú Standards-Based**: Follows **10 industry security standards** (like having 10 expert teachers check your work)
4. **üéì Beginner-Friendly**: Clear messages that explain what's wrong and how to fix it
5. **üí∞ 100% Free**: No hidden costs, no subscriptions, completely open-source

---

## 2. Why Do I Need PyGuard?

### Real-World Example: The Password Problem

Let's say you wrote this code:

```python
# DON'T DO THIS!
password = "MySecret123"
print(f"Your password is: {password}")
```

**What's wrong?** This code has TWO major security problems:

1. **Hardcoded Password**: The password is written directly in the code where anyone can see it
2. **Password Printed**: The password is shown on screen where others might see it

**What could happen?**
- A hacker could steal your password
- Your account could be compromised
- Your personal data could be leaked

**How PyGuard helps:**
```
[HIGH] Hardcoded Credentials: Password detected on line 2
FIX: Store passwords in environment variables or a secure vault
OWASP: ASVS-2.6.3 | CWE: CWE-798
```

PyGuard will:
1. Find the problem
2. Tell you exactly what's wrong
3. Explain how to fix it
4. Reference official security standards

---

## 3. Installing PyGuard

### Step 1: Check if You Have Python

Before installing PyGuard, make sure you have Python installed.

**Windows:**
1. Open Command Prompt (search for "cmd" in Start Menu)
2. Type: `python --version`
3. Press Enter

**Mac/Linux:**
1. Open Terminal (search for "Terminal" in Applications)
2. Type: `python3 --version`
3. Press Enter

**What should you see?**
```
Python 3.8.0 (or higher)
```

If you see this, great! If not, [download Python here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Step 2: Install PyGuard

**The Easy Way (Recommended):**

```bash
pip install pyguard
```

**Installing from Source (if the above doesn't work):**

```bash
# Download PyGuard
git clone https://github.com/cboyd0319/PyGuard.git

# Go into the folder
cd PyGuard

# Install it
pip install -e .
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

Check that PyGuard is installed:

```bash
pyguard --version
```

You should see something like:
```
PyGuard v0.8.0 - World's Best Python Security Tool
```

**‚úÖ If you see this, PyGuard is installed successfully!**

---

## 4. Your First PyGuard Scan

### Example 1: Scan a Single File

Let's create a simple Python file to test:

**1. Create a file called `test.py` with this code:**

```python
# test.py
password = "secret123"
eval(user_input)
print("Hello, World!")
```

**2. Run PyGuard on it:**

```bash
pyguard test.py
```

**3. Watch PyGuard work!**

You'll see PyGuard analyze your code and find problems:

```
PyGuard v0.8.0 - Analyzing test.py
‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê

[HIGH] Hardcoded Credentials: Password detected on line 2
  Fix: Use environment variables or secrets management
  OWASP: ASVS-2.6.3 | CWE: CWE-798

[CRITICAL] Code Injection: eval() detected on line 3
  Fix: Never use eval() with untrusted input
  OWASP: ASVS-5.2.1 | CWE: CWE-95

Found 2 security issues (2 HIGH, 0 MEDIUM, 0 LOW)
```

### Example 2: Scan a Folder

If you have a project with multiple files:

```bash
pyguard src/
```

This will scan all Python files in the `src/` folder.

---

## 5. Understanding the Results

### What Do the Results Mean?

When PyGuard finds a problem, it shows you:

```
[SEVERITY] Category: Description on line X
  Fix: How to fix it
  OWASP: Security standard reference
  CWE: Weakness classification
```

### Severity Levels Explained

| Severity | What It Means | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **CRITICAL** | **FIX IMMEDIATELY** - Severe security risk | `eval()` with user input |
| **HIGH** | **FIX VERY SOON** - Serious security problem | Hardcoded passwords |
| **MEDIUM** | **Fix when possible** - Important but not urgent | Missing input validation |
| **LOW** | **Nice to fix** - Minor issues | Code style problems |

### Understanding the Codes

**OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project):**
- World's #1 security organization
- Sets standards for secure coding
- Example: ASVS-2.6.3 = Credential Storage requirement

**CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration):**
- Database of security weaknesses
- Each has a unique number
- Example: CWE-798 = Hardcoded Credentials

**You don't need to memorize these!** PyGuard provides them for reference.

## 6. Fixing Problems Automatically

### The Magic of Auto-Fix

PyGuard can **automatically fix** many problems for you!

### Example: Fixing Weak Cryptography

**Before (Insecure):**
```python
import hashlib
password_hash = hashlib.md5(password.encode()).hexdigest()
```

**Run PyGuard with auto-fix:**
```bash
pyguard --auto-fix myfile.py
```

**After (Secure):**
```python
import hashlib
password_hash = hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest()  # FIXED: Changed from MD5 to SHA256
```

**What PyGuard did:**
1. Found the weak MD5 hash
2. Replaced it with secure SHA256
3. Added a comment explaining the change
4. Created a backup of your original file

### What Can PyGuard Auto-Fix?

PyGuard can automatically fix **20+ types of problems**:

**Security Fixes:**
- ‚úÖ Weak cryptography (MD5 ‚Üí SHA256)
- ‚úÖ Insecure JWT configurations
- ‚úÖ SQL injection patterns
- ‚úÖ GraphQL injection
- ‚úÖ Template injection risks
- ‚úÖ Missing API rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Container security issues

**Code Quality Fixes:**
- ‚úÖ Code formatting (Black style)
- ‚úÖ Import organization
- ‚úÖ Whitespace issues
- ‚úÖ Docstring missing warnings

### Safety First

**PyGuard is SAFE to use because:**
1. ‚úÖ Creates backups before making changes
2. ‚úÖ Only fixes what it's confident about
3. ‚úÖ Shows you what it changed
4. ‚úÖ You can review changes before accepting

## 7. Common Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1: "Command not found"

**Error:**
```
bash: pyguard: command not found
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Make sure it's installed
pip install pyguard

# Or use python -m
python -m pyguard test.py
```

### Problem 2: "No such file or directory"

**Error:**
```
Error: File not found
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check you're in the right folder
pwd  # Shows current directory

# Use absolute path
pyguard /full/path/to/file.py
```

### Problem 3: "Permission denied"

**Error:**
```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Add --user flag
pip install --user pyguard

# Or use sudo (Mac/Linux)
sudo pip install pyguard
```

### Problem 4: Too Many Results

**Problem:** PyGuard finds hundreds of issues and it's overwhelming.

**Solution:** Focus on security first:
```bash
# Only show security issues
pyguard --security-only src/

# Only show HIGH and CRITICAL
pyguard --min-severity HIGH src/
```

---

## 8. Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Student Project

**Scenario:** You're a student working on a school project.

**Your code:**
```python
# login.py
def login(username, password):
    if password == "admin123":  # Hardcoded password!
        print("Welcome admin!")
        return True
    return False
```

**Run PyGuard:**
```bash
pyguard login.py
```

**Results:**
```
[HIGH] Hardcoded Credentials: Password on line 3
  Fix: Load from environment: os.environ.get('ADMIN_PASSWORD')
  OWASP: ASVS-2.6.3 | CWE: CWE-798
```

**Fixed code:**
```python
import os

def login(username, password):
    admin_password = os.environ.get('ADMIN_PASSWORD')
    if password == admin_password:
        print("Welcome admin!")
        return True
    return False
```

### Example 2: Web API Project

**Scenario:** You're building a REST API.

**Your code:**
```python
# api.py
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/users')
def get_users():
    user_id = request.args.get('id')
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"  # SQL Injection!
    return jsonify(execute_query(query))
```

**Run PyGuard:**
```bash
pyguard api.py --auto-fix
```

**PyGuard finds:**
1. SQL injection vulnerability
2. Missing API rate limiting
3. No input validation

**Auto-fixed code:**
```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_limiter import Limiter  # ADDED: Rate limiter import

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/api/users')
@limiter.limit("100/hour")  # ADDED: Rate limiting
def get_users():
    user_id = request.args.get('id')
    # FIXED: Use parameterized query
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?"
    return jsonify(execute_query(query, (user_id,)))
```

### Example 3: Data Science Project

**Scenario:** You're analyzing data and sharing code.

**Your code:**
```python
# analysis.py
import pickle

def load_data(filename):
    with open(filename, 'rb') as f:
        return pickle.load(f)  # Unsafe deserialization!

api_key = "sk_1234567890"  # Hardcoded API key!
data = load_data('data.pkl')
```

**Run PyGuard:**
```bash
pyguard analysis.py
```

**Results:**
```
[HIGH] Unsafe Deserialization: pickle.load() on line 5
  Fix: Use JSON or validate data source
  OWASP: ASVS-5.5.3 | CWE: CWE-502

[HIGH] Hardcoded Credentials: API key on line 7
  Fix: Use environment variable
  OWASP: ASVS-2.6.3 | CWE: CWE-798
```
