## Documentation Governance (NON‑NEGOTIABLE — ENFORCED)

To prevent documentation sprawl and ensure consistency, the following rules are mandatory:

- Version-specific progress trackers: Use version-specific tracking documents for each major/minor release.
  - v0.5.0 and earlier: `docs/development/UPDATEv2.md` (archived)
  - v0.6.0 and later: `docs/development/UPDATEv06.md` (active)
  - Do not create new status/summary/progress docs per PR.
  - Append to/update the current version tracker with clearly dated entries.

- Single capabilities source of truth: `docs/reference/capabilities-reference.md`.
  - When adding/changing features, update this file and align the README features section.

- Docs location policy: Never write docs to the repository root.
  - All documentation must live under `docs/` (or subfolders like `docs/guides`, `docs/reference`, `docs/development`).
  - PRs adding docs outside `docs/` will be rejected.

- Enforcement:
  - PR reviewers must verify these rules before approval.
  - CI will run doc/link/style checks; violations block merges.

These rules are non‑negotiable. Exceptions require maintainer approval and must be documented in the current version tracker (currently `docs/development/UPDATEv06.md` for v0.6.0).

## Phase 3: Auto-Fix Expansion

### Objective

Maintain **100% auto-fix coverage** for all 300+ new security checks.

### 3.1 Auto-Fix Architecture Requirements

**Quality Standards:**

- ✅ All fixes must be idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- ✅ AST-based transformations (no regex replacements)
- ✅ Preserve code formatting and comments
- ✅ Include educational comments with CWE/CVE references
- ✅ Support rollback via backups
- ✅ Test coverage for each auto-fix

**Fix Categories:**

1. **Safe Fixes** (apply automatically):
   - Add missing parameters (e.g., `secure=True` for cookies)
   - Replace deprecated functions (e.g., `md5()` → `sha256()`)
   - Add imports (e.g., `import os` for `os.getenv()`)
   - Remove dangerous flags (e.g., `shell=True` → `shell=False`)

2. **Unsafe Fixes** (require --unsafe flag):
   - Change application logic
   - Modify function signatures
   - Alter data structures
   - Refactor code patterns

### 3.2 Auto-Fix Implementation Strategy

**For Each New Check:**

1. Design fix pattern using AST visitor
2. Implement transformation logic
3. Add comprehensive tests (10+ edge cases)
4. Document fix rationale with CWE mapping
5. Ensure idempotency testing
6. Performance benchmark (<100ms per fix)

**Example Auto-Fix Template:**

```python
class FixWeakHashAlgorithm(ASTVisitor):
    """
    Fix: Replace MD5/SHA1 with SHA256 for password hashing.
    CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
    Severity: HIGH
    Auto-Fix: SAFE
    """

    def visit_Call(self, node: ast.Call):
        if self.is_weak_hash_function(node):
            # Replace hashlib.md5() with hashlib.sha256()
            return self.create_safe_hash_call(node)
        return node

    def create_safe_hash_call(self, node):
        # AST transformation with educational comment
        new_node = ast.Call(
            func=ast.Attribute(
                value=ast.Name(id='hashlib', ctx=ast.Load()),
                attr='sha256',
                ctx=ast.Load()
            ),
            args=node.args,
            keywords=node.keywords
        )
        # Add comment explaining the fix
        ast.copy_location(new_node, node)
        return new_node
```

---

## Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance ⚠️ **CRITICAL - NON-NEGOTIABLE**

### Objective

Ensure all new security checks meet production quality standards.

---

## 🚨 **COPILOT AGENT: READ THIS FIRST** 🚨

**TEST COVERAGE IS ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY. NO EXCEPTIONS.**

Every single security check MUST include comprehensive tests BEFORE the implementation is considered complete. Code without tests will be REJECTED.

**Why This Matters:**

- Security tools with false positives destroy user trust
- Untested code leads to production bugs in critical security features
- We're targeting market leadership - quality is non-negotiable
- 90%+ test coverage is a MINIMUM requirement, not a goal

**Your Responsibility:**
When implementing ANY security check or framework rule:

1. ✅ Write tests FIRST (TDD approach preferred)
2. ✅ Ensure 100% of your code has test coverage
3. ✅ Test both vulnerable AND safe code patterns
4. ✅ Include edge cases and corner cases
5. ✅ Run tests locally BEFORE committing
6. ✅ Document test rationale in docstrings

**If you submit code without adequate tests, it will be sent back. No shortcuts.**

---

  - At least 2 false positive prevention tests
- ✅ Each test must include:
  - Descriptive test name explaining what's being tested

**Auto-Fix Tests (REQUIRED if auto-fix exists):**

**Integration Tests (REQUIRED for framework rules):**

```

**Test Coverage Measurement:**

- ✅ Use pytest-cov to measure coverage
- ✅ Require 100% line coverage for new code
- ✅ Require 95%+ branch coverage
- ✅ Run coverage report in CI/CD

```bash
# Required command before committing:
pytest --cov=pyguard/lib/new_module --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=95
```

---

### 4.2 Test Suite Expansion (MANDATORY TARGETS)

**Current State (Updated 2025-10-22):**

- ✅ **2,912+ tests** (up from 1,002 - **190% increase!**)
- ✅ **88%+ coverage** (up from 84% - exceeded intermediate target!)
- ✅ **0 linting errors, 0 type errors**

**Progress Tracking:**

| Milestone | Target Tests | Actual Tests | Target Coverage | Actual Coverage | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Baseline** | 1,002 | 1,002 ✅ | 84% | 84% ✅ | Complete |
| **Month 1-2** | 4,802 | **2,912+** 🎯 | 88% | **88%+** ✅ | **In Progress** |
| **Month 3-4** | 8,602 | TBD | 90% | TBD | Planned |
| **Month 5-6** | 10,502 | TBD | 92% | TBD | Planned |

**Target State (End of Plan):**

- 🎯 **10,500+ total tests** (10x expansion from baseline)
- 🎯 **90%+ overall coverage** (maintain excellence)
- 🎯 **100% coverage on all new code** (no exceptions)

**Revised Calculation (Based on Actual Progress):**

- Baseline: 1,002 tests at 55 checks
- Current: 2,912+ tests at 184 checks (+129 checks added)
- Tests added: ~1,910 tests (14.7 tests per new check average)
- Remaining: 116 checks to reach 300
- Estimated tests needed: ~1,700 tests (14.7 × 116)
- **Projected total: 4,612+ tests** at 300 checks

**Note:** Actual test-per-check ratio (14.7) is lower than planned (38) because:

- Integration tests cover multiple checks simultaneously
- Framework tests validate multiple security patterns at once
- Shared test fixtures reduce duplication
- This efficiency is acceptable as we maintain 88%+ coverage

---

### 4.3 Quality Metrics (ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA - MUST MEET ALL)

  - If precision <98%, refine detection logic

- ✅ **Recall: >95%** (detection rate, minimize false negatives)
  - Test against known vulnerable code dataset
  - Compare with other tools (Snyk, Bandit, Semgrep)
  - If recall <95%, expand detection patterns

- ✅ **Context Awareness: 100%**
  - Check considers code context (not just pattern matching)
  - Framework-specific rules use framework knowledge
  - Comments and docstrings inform severity

#### **Performance (CRITICAL):**

- ✅ **Per-file scan time: <10ms average**
  - Profile with cProfile or py-spy
  - Optimize hot paths
  - Use caching where appropriate

  - Tests run in parallel safely
  - No shared state between workers
  - Deterministic output regardless of parallelism

#### **Auto-Fix Quality (CRITICAL):**

- ✅ **Success rate: >95%**
  - Fix applies cleanly to 95%+ of vulnerable code
  - Remaining 5% get manual fix guidance

- ✅ **Correctness: 100%**
  - Fixed code passes security check (no more issues)
  - Fixed code is syntactically valid (AST parses)
  - Fixed code preserves original functionality (when possible)

- ✅ **Idempotency: 100%**
  - Running fix twice produces identical result
  - No cumulative changes or drift

#### **Documentation (CRITICAL):**

- ✅ **CWE Mapping: 100% of checks**
  - Every check maps to at least one CWE
  - CWE description included in documentation
  - Link to official CWE database

- ✅ **OWASP Mapping: 80%+ of checks**
  - Map to OWASP Top 10 or ASVS when applicable
  - Include OWASP category in metadata

- ✅ **Examples: 100% of checks**
  - Vulnerable code example in docstring
  - Safe code example in docstring
  - Fix example (if auto-fix available)
