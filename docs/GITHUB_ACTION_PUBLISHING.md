## üì¶ Release Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests Pass

```bash
# Check all workflows are passing
gh run list --workflow=test.yml --limit 1
gh run list --workflow=test-action.yml --limit 1
gh run list --workflow=lint.yml --limit 1
```

### Step 2: Update Version

1. Update version in `pyproject.toml`:
   ```toml
   version = "0.3.0"
   ```

2. Update version in `action.yml` if referenced:
   ```yaml
   # Update any version references in description or comments
   ```

3. Update CHANGELOG.md:
   ```markdown
   ## [0.3.0] - 2025-01-XX
   
   ### Added
   - GitHub Action support
   - SARIF upload capability
   - Comprehensive example workflows
   
   ### Changed
   - Improved security detection
   
   ### Fixed
   - Bug fixes
   ```

4. Update README.md badges:
   ```markdown
   ![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.3.0-blue.svg)
   ```

### Step 3: Create Release Tag

```bash
# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Release v0.3.0"
git push origin main

# Create and push tag
git tag -a v0.3.0 -m "Release version 0.3.0"
git push origin v0.3.0
```

The release workflow will automatically:
- Build Python package
- Publish to PyPI
- Create GitHub release
- Update major version tag (v0)
- Generate SBOM and attestations

### Step 4: Verify Release

1. Check GitHub Release: https://github.com/cboyd0319/PyGuard/releases
2. Check PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/pyguard/
3. Verify major version tag updated: `git ls-remote --tags origin`

### Step 5: Publish to Marketplace

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Releases** (right sidebar)
3. Find your latest release (v0.3.0)
4. Click **"Publish this Action to the GitHub Marketplace"** button
5. Review the action details:
   - **Primary Category**: Code Quality
   - **Secondary Category**: Continuous Integration
   - **Tags**: security, python, code-quality, SARIF, scanning
6. Accept the GitHub Marketplace terms
7. Click **"Publish Release"**

### Step 6: Verify Marketplace Listing

1. Go to: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pyguard-security-scanner
2. Verify:
   - [ ] Action appears in search results
   - [ ] Description is clear and compelling
   - [ ] README renders correctly
   - [ ] Example usage is visible
   - [ ] Inputs/outputs are documented
   - [ ] Branding (icon/color) displays correctly

## üîÑ Update Process (For Future Releases)

### For Patch Releases (0.3.0 ‚Üí 0.3.1)

```bash
# Update version
vim pyproject.toml  # Change version
vim docs/CHANGELOG.md  # Add changelog entry

# Commit and tag
git commit -am "Release v0.3.1"
git tag -a v0.3.1 -m "Release version 0.3.1"
git push origin main v0.3.1
```

Major version tag (v0) automatically updates to point to v0.3.1.

### For Minor Releases (0.3.0 ‚Üí 0.4.0)

Same as patch, but include more significant changes in CHANGELOG.

### For Major Releases (0.3.0 ‚Üí 1.0.0)

```bash
# Update version
vim pyproject.toml  # Change to 1.0.0
vim docs/CHANGELOG.md  # Add detailed changelog

# Commit and tag
git commit -am "Release v1.0.0"
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0 - First stable release"
git push origin main v1.0.0
```

This creates a new major version tag (v1) pointing to v1.0.0.

## üìù Marketplace Best Practices

### 1. Clear Value Proposition

Your action should clearly state:
- ‚úÖ What it does: "Comprehensive Python security and code quality scanning"
- ‚úÖ Why use it: "Replace 7+ tools with one action"
- ‚úÖ Key benefits: "55+ security checks, SARIF native, 179+ auto-fixes"

### 2. Easy to Get Started

- ‚úÖ Provide a minimal working example upfront
- ‚úÖ Show results users can expect
- ‚úÖ Keep required inputs minimal

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation

- ‚úÖ Document ALL inputs with clear descriptions
- ‚úÖ Provide example workflows for common scenarios
- ‚úÖ Include troubleshooting section
- ‚úÖ Link to detailed guides

### 4. Trust Signals

- ‚úÖ Badges for test status, coverage, security scans
- ‚úÖ Open source license (MIT)
- ‚úÖ Active maintenance (recent commits)
- ‚úÖ Security policy
- ‚úÖ Code of conduct
- ‚úÖ Contributing guidelines

### 5. SEO & Discoverability

Include these keywords in your action.yml description:
- security
- code-quality
- python
- SARIF
- vulnerability-scanning
- OWASP
- CWE
- static-analysis
- code-scanning
- DevSecOps

### 6. Version Management

Users can reference your action in three ways:
```yaml
uses: cboyd0319/PyGuard@v0.3.0  # Specific version (pinned)
uses: cboyd0319/PyGuard@v0      # Latest v0.x.x (auto-updates)
uses: cboyd0319/PyGuard@main    # Latest main branch (bleeding edge)
```

Recommend `@v0` or `@v1` for most users in documentation.
