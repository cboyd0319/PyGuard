# PyGuard Advanced Features

**Version 0.3.0** introduces cutting-edge capabilities that differentiate PyGuard from all other Python security tools.

## 🚀 What Makes PyGuard Different?

PyGuard is no longer a security scanner — it's an **educational security platform** that helps developers learn secure coding while protecting their code.

### Two Revolutionary Features

1. **🎯 Jupyter Notebook Security Analysis** — Native support for `.ipynb` files
2. **🤖 AI-Powered Explanations** — Learn why vulnerabilities matter and how to fix them

## Feature 1: Jupyter Notebook Security

### The Problem

- **60%+ of data science code** is written in Jupyter notebooks
- Most security tools **don't support notebooks** or require conversion to `.py` files
- Conversion **loses context**: cell execution order, magic commands, outputs
- Data scientists need security tools **designed for their workflow**

### PyGuard's Solution

Native `.ipynb` file analysis with notebook-specific detections:

✅ **Cell-by-cell analysis** — Scans each cell independently  
✅ **Execution order tracking** — Detects variables used before definition  
✅ **Magic command detection** — Identifies dangerous `!`, `%system`, `%%bash`  
✅ **Output scanning** — Checks cell outputs for sensitive paths  
✅ **Cross-cell dependencies** — Analyzes data flow between cells  
✅ **Automated fixes** — Redacts secrets, fixes vulnerabilities

### Quick Example

```python
from pyguard import scan_notebook

# Scan a notebook
issues = scan_notebook('my_analysis.ipynb')

for issue in issues:
    print(f"{issue.severity}: {issue.message}")
    print(f"  Cell {issue.cell_index}, Line {issue.line_number}")
    print(f"  Fix: {issue.fix_suggestion}")
```

### Detections (8+ Categories)

| Vulnerability | Example | Unique to PyGuard? |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| Hardcoded Secrets | `api_key = 'sk-123...'` | ✅ Yes |
| Magic Commands | `!rm -rf /`, `%%bash` | ✅ Yes |
| Code Injection | `eval(user_input)` | No |
| Command Injection | `subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True)` | No |
| Path Disclosure | System paths in error outputs | ✅ Yes |
| Execution Order | Using vars before definition | ✅ Yes |
| Unsafe Extensions | `%load_ext untrusted` | ✅ Yes |
| Pickle Deserialization | `pickle.load(untrusted)` | No |

### Market Position

| Tool | Notebook Support | Cell Order Analysis | Magic Commands | Output Scanning |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **PyGuard** | ✅ Native | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Bandit | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Ruff | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Semgrep | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| nbqa | ⚠️ Converts | ❌ No | ❌ No | ❌ No |

**Result**: PyGuard is the **only tool** with comprehensive Jupyter notebook security support.

## Feature 2: AI-Powered Educational Explanations

### The Problem

- Security tools report **what's wrong** but not **why it matters**
- Developers don't learn from security scans
- No context on **how to fix properly**
- Junior developers struggle with security concepts

### PyGuard's Solution

Natural language explanations for every vulnerability:

✅ **What is it?** — Clear, jargon-free descriptions  
✅ **Why dangerous?** — Real-world impact and consequences  
✅ **How to exploit?** — Attack vectors for technical understanding  
✅ **How to fix?** — Step-by-step remediation  
✅ **Code examples** — Vulnerable vs secure patterns  
✅ **References** — OWASP, CWE, educational links

### Comprehensive Coverage (7+ Vulnerabilities)

- SQL Injection (CWE-89, OWASP A03:2021)
- Command Injection (CWE-78, OWASP A03:2021)
- Code Injection (CWE-95, OWASP A03:2021)
- Hardcoded Secrets (CWE-798, OWASP A07:2021)
- Unsafe Deserialization (CWE-502, OWASP A08:2021)
- Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79, OWASP A03:2021)
- Path Traversal (CWE-22, OWASP A01:2021)

### Quick Example

```python
from pyguard import explain

# Get detailed explanation
explanation = explain("SQL_INJECTION", level="beginner")

print(explanation.description)
# "SQL Injection occurs when user input is directly incorporated into 
#  SQL queries without proper sanitization..."

print(explanation.how_to_fix)
# "1. Use parameterized queries (prepared statements)
#  2. Use ORM frameworks (SQLAlchemy, Django ORM)
#  3. Input validation and sanitization..."
```

### Fix Rationale

PyGuard explains **why a specific fix** was chosen:

```python
from pyguard import AIExplainer

explainer = AIExplainer()
rationale = explainer.explain_fix(
    original="query = f'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}'",
    fixed="query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s'",
    vulnerability_type="SQL_INJECTION"
)

print(rationale.why_this_fix)
# "Parameterized queries prevent SQL injection by separating SQL logic from data."

print(rationale.security_impact)
# "Eliminates SQL injection vulnerability completely."

print(rationale.alternatives)
# ["Use ORM framework (SQLAlchemy, Django ORM)",
#  "Validate and sanitize input (less secure)",
#  "Use stored procedures"]
```

### Educational Levels

PyGuard adjusts complexity based on your team:

**Beginner** (Simplified)
- Simple language
- Omits technical exploitation
- Focuses on practical fixes

**Intermediate** (Balanced) — Default
- Balanced technical and practical
- Includes exploitation basics
- Complete fix guidance

**Advanced** (Technical)
- Full exploitation details
- Attack vectors and techniques
- Security analysis depth

```python
# For junior developers
beginner = explain("CODE_INJECTION", level="beginner")

# For security experts
advanced = explain("CODE_INJECTION", level="advanced")
```

### Interactive Learning

Generate complete learning modules with quizzes:

```python
content = explainer.generate_learning_content("COMMAND_INJECTION")

print(content["quiz_question"])
# {
#   "question": "Why is subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True) dangerous?",
#   "options": [
#     "It's slower than shell=False",
#     "It allows shell metacharacter injection",  ✓ Correct
#     "It requires more memory",
#     "It's deprecated"
#   ],
#   "explanation": "shell=True allows shell metacharacters like ; | & to chain commands maliciously."
# }
```
