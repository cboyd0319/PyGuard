# Contributing

Thanks for helping make PyGuard better. This repo uses **tight docs hygiene** and **fast feedback**.

## Dev setup

```bash
# Clone + env
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PyGuard.git
cd PyGuard
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Docs tooling
npm i -g markdownlint-cli
pip install vale
```

## Lint & test

```bash
# Code
make test
make lint
make format

# Docs
markdownlint "**/*.md"
vale docs/
npx linkinator README.md docs/**/*.md
```

### Running Tests

PyGuard has a comprehensive test suite with 2,369 tests. For detailed testing documentation, see [docs/development/TESTING_GUIDE.md](docs/development/TESTING_GUIDE.md).

Quick reference:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests without coverage (faster for development)
pytest --no-cov

# Run tests in parallel (32% faster)
pytest -n auto

# Run only fast tests (skip slow integration tests)
pytest -m "not slow"

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_cache.py
```

**Performance**: Full suite runs in ~20s (sequential) or ~14s (parallel with -n auto).
