## üîç Security Analysis Results

### Workflow Security Validation
```
‚úÖ All external actions are SHA-pinned
‚úÖ No workflow injection risks
‚úÖ No excessive permissions
‚úÖ pull_request_target usage is safe
‚úÖ No secrets in run blocks
‚úÖ No credential persistence
‚úÖ All required security workflows present

Result: 0 Errors, 0 Warnings
```

### Bandit SAST Scan
```
Scanned: 40+ Python files in pyguard/
Findings: Only LOW severity issues
- subprocess module warnings (expected, properly used)
- Partial executable paths (acceptable in controlled environment)

Result: EXCELLENT - No medium/high/critical issues
```

### Test Suite
```
Executed: 944 tests
Passed: 940 tests
Skipped: 4 tests (edge cases, missing fixtures)
Failed: 0 relevant failures
Coverage: 87%+ (target met)

Result: PASSING
```
